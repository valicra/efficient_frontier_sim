The efficient frontier is a concept from modern portfolio theory that represents a set of optimal portfolios offering the highest expected return for a given level of risk or the lowest risk for a given level of expected return. Graphically, it appears as a curve on a risk-return chart, with risk typically measured by standard deviation and return by expected portfolio return. Portfolios lying on the efficient frontier are considered efficient because they maximize expected return for a specified level of risk or minimize risk for a specified expected return.

An optimal portfolio is a portfolio that lies on the efficient frontier and aligns with an investor's risk tolerance, investment goals, and preferences. It represents the best combination of assets to achieve the desired balance between risk and return. While there are multiple points on the efficient frontier, the optimal portfolio for a particular investor is determined by their individual utility function or risk-return trade-off preferences.
